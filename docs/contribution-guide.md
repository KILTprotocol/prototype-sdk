# Contribution Guide

## Documentation

We want the KILT SDK to be easy to use for all fellow developers. We ‚ù§Ô∏èwell-documented code.

In the KILT SDK, podules and public methods are documented inline, in the code. The API doc is generated from these inline "doc blocks", and is available at our [online API Doc][api].

We're using [jsdoc][jsdoc] linting rules, along with [typedoc][typedoc] to generate the documentation.

### Documenting modules

Direct child folders of `src` such as `attestation` should be marked as `@modules`, so that they're listed in the [online API Doc][api] main menu.

Some of these modules are purely technical utilities, such as `crypto`. Others map to KILT concepts, such as `attestation`.

Both types of modules shall be documented with a short text in one of their child files (usually `X.ts` if the folder is called `x`):

* For technical modules, you're free to write this text as you like;
* For modules that map to a KILT concept, we recommend that you structure your text as follows:
  * Paragraph 1: Explanation of the overall concept, and the role it fulfills in the KILT Protocol;
  * Paragraph 2: Technical details of interest.

For reference, look for example at the doc block in `Attestation.ts`.

### Documenting public methods

Public methods should be documented. Some lint rules are set up: see the `jsdoc` rules in `eslintrc.json`, and [their description][jsdoc].

Additionally, we recommend that you observe the following guidelines, to make the documentation as helpful as possible:

* Method description:
  * Make it concise and clear;
  * Start with a capitalized verb in the 3rd person;
  * If the method is async and/or static, add [ASYNC] and/or [STATIC] right before the description content.
* `@param` and `@returns` fields: don't add types, since this is automatically added into the API doc;
* Make sure you explain opaque abbreviations or jargon (example: TxStatus = transaction status);
* When referring to SDK Classes and methods, make sure you link them in, using `[[]]`;
* `@example`:
  * Create it as valid, executable code üòé;
  * Illustrate only this method's functionality, but also provide enough context for fellow developers to try it out:
    * Imports;
    * Preparation step;
    * Actual function call;
    * Expected output;
    * Suggestion for the next step;
    * ...
  * Don't hesitate to include comments.


üí°The linting rules for the example snippet are not the same as the SDK codebase linting rules. For example, the example snippet should make use of semicolumns. You can see the full ruleset in `.eslintrc-jsdoc.json`, but the linter will help you figure the rules out anyways.

Example of a method doc block that follows these guidelines:

```javascript
/**
 * [STATIC] [ASYNC] Revokes an attestation.
 *
 * @param claimHash - The hash of the claim that corresponds to the attestation to revoke.
 * @param identity - The identity used to revoke the attestation. It should be an attester identity, or an identity with delegated rights.
 * @returns A promise containing the [[TxStatus]] (transaction status).
 * @example ```javascript
 * // revoke the attestation that's mapped to the claim hash "0xd8024cdc147c4fa9221cd177" with `identity` (to create `identity`, see `buildFromMnemonic` and `generateMnemonic` in the `Identity` class). The attestation can not be un-revoked.
 * Attestation.revoke("0xd8024cdc147c4fa9221cd177", identity)
 * ```
 */
```

### Check locally how the [online API Doc][api] will look like

* Run `yarn build:docs` within the `sdk-js` folder. This generates the doc at `sdk-js/docs/api`.
* Open any of the generated files in your browser, such as `sdk-js/docs/api/classes/attestation.attestation-1.html`. You can now use the menu or inline links to navigate across modules and classes.

Make sure you don't commit these generated files.

## Tests

Test coverage does not seem to be fail in all cases, except for testWatch.

## AWS build fails

If the sdk build fails on AWS, please check the error log.

Usually it says:

```bash
    npm ERR! publish Failed PUT 403
    npm ERR! code E403
    npm ERR! You cannot publish over the previously published versions: 0.0.3. : @kiltprotocol/sdk-js
```

This is on purpose as a new push to master branch triggers a build, but should not automatically and unintended release a new version.

Please update package.json's version in order to publish a new version to the registry by AWS after pushing to master.
